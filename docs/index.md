# Chromatix: Differentiable lightfield simulation 

Chromatix is a differentiable lightfield simulator based on [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax). We've build 





We support multi-GPU setups and are working on implementing multi-wavelength support.


Have a look at the examples to see what we've done with Chromatix so far!

## Philosophy

Chromatix is first and foremost written for *research*. In practice this means that Chromatix is nothing more than a set of commonly required functions and datatypes for working with lightfields, and that these are Jax-transformable.
