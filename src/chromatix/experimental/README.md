# Chromatix.experimental

This folder contains experimental implementations for the following features:
* Differentiable XNH - a fully differentiable x-ray nano holographic pipeline.


Experimental means that these features are more or less ready to be used, but we haven't quite figured out how to merge them into Chromatix yet. Expect some rough edges, and the API is in no way guaranteed.
